#+TITLE: SSSP

This will visually demonstrate single-source shortest path graph algorithms.

We will animate Dijkstra's algorithm and run it on a graph that is designed
to show exponential runtime of Dijkstra with negative edges.

TODO: deal with source and target state; ideas:
- make "source" and "target" into graph model attributes
  OR
- make them into private variables and only access them via setters/getters
- remove them as arguments to the graph vis method
